EXAMINATION: CTA aortic dissection - chest, abdomen, and pelvis including iliac arteries

IMPRESSION:  

New moderate left and small right simple pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis. Otherwise, no significant change in the Stanford type B aortic intramural hematoma compared to October 14, 2022.  

CLINICAL INDICATION: 65 yo with AAA :: AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm)

TECHNIQUE: 
CT scanning of the chest was performed without administration of intravenous contrast. Following this, CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed following intravenous administration of contrast. Reformats were constructed in the sagittal and coronal planes. MIP images were performed and sent to PACS for archiving.  
Intravenous contrast: IOPAMIDOL 76 % INTRAVENOUS SOLUTION: 100 mL 

COMPARISON: CT aortic dissection dated October 14, 2022.

INTERPRETATION: 

SCOUT: No additional findings.
 
AIRWAYS, LUNGS AND PLEURA: The central tracheobronchial tree is patent. There are new moderate left and small right simple pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. 

MEDIASTINUM: There are no enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes. The visualized portion of the thyroid gland is unremarkable.    

HEART AND VESSELS: The heart is normal in size. There are coronary artery and aortic calcifications. There is left aortic arch with bovine variant branching.. The central pulmonary arteries have normal caliber. Again seen is intramural hematoma extending from distal to the left subclavian artery through the level of the diaphragm. No contrast opacification of the false lumen is seen on arterial phase.. No change in size of the distal aortic arch/proximal descending aorta measuring up to 3.8 cm. There is no pericardial effusion. 

LIVER: Again seen is a 2 cm left lobe hepatic cyst, stable compared to prior study. 
BILIARY SYSTEM: There is no biliary ductal dilatation.
GALLBLADDER: No radiopaque gallstones. 

PANCREAS: Within normal limits. 
SPLEEN: Within normal limits. 
ADRENALS: Within normal limits.

KIDNEYS/URETERS: No hydronephrosis or obstructing stones. 

BOWEL/MESENTERY: No bowel obstruction or wall thickening. Diverticulosis is present, without evidence of diverticulitis.  The appendix is not seen; however, there are no secondary signs of acute appendicitis. 

URINARY BLADDER: Within normal limits.
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: No pelvic masses.

PERITONEUM/RETROPERITONEUM: No free air. No free or loculated fluid. 
LYMPH NODES: No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. 
VESSELS: Again seen is a stable eccentric outpouching the infrarenal abdominal aorta (series 6 image 62) similar to the prior and may represent a small eccentric aneurysm or penetrating atheromatous ulcer

BONES: No destructive osseous lesions
SOFT TISSUES: Within normal limits.

TUBES AND LINES: None.
