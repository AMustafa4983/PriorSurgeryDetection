# Prior Surgery Detection in Radiology Reports

## Overview
The Prior Surgery Detection project is a machine learning application designed to identify prior surgeries from radiology reports. It uses natural language processing techniques to analyze text data from radiology reports and classify them based on the presence of prior surgeries.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes NLP techniques to process and analyze radiology report text.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Incorporates a deep learning model to classify reports as indicating prior surgery or not.
- **Data Augmentation**: Employs data augmentation techniques to balance the dataset and improve model performance.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Generates word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in the dataset.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AMustafa4983/PriorSurgeryDetection.git
   cd PriorSurgeryDetection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   ```
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

The main Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`) contains the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Run the notebook cells in sequence to replicate the project's results.
